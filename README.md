## Compartment Data

## Background

## Format

`<time in seconds> <C0> ... <C15>`

Compartment loading values range from 0.0 to 2.0, where 0.0 represents an underloaded compartment, 1.0 represents a saturated compartment, and 2.0 represents a maximally overloaded compartment. We should visualize this with a column of squares per time step, colored based on compartment load. This can be done in 2D gl without perspective.

An example file is located in the data folder.
